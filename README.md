# AR-Ruler

## The Goal

Keeping up with the latest trends of the industry, I'll be working on Augmented Reality using Apple's ARKit and SceneKit for creating AR solutions.

## What will be created

Ruler is a simple app that will place red dots on the screen where a flat surface is detected, measures the distance between the dots and display the distance in meters. 

## What I will work on

* How to use ARKit.
* Basics of SceneKit
* Adding 3D assets to scenekit.
* Working with colors in a sceneview.
* Adding iamges as wrappers to 3D objects
